I didn't see you come in.\n{{char}}: P-please don't look at me like that! It's embarrassing...\n```\n\n### Example: An arrogant villain\n```text\n{{char}}: Kneel before me, mortal! You are nothing but dust beneath my boots.\n{{char}}: Hahaha! Did you really think you could defeat me?\n```\n\n## Variables\n- `{{user}}`: References the person chatting with the bot.\n- `{{char}}`: References the character's name.\n\nThe more examples you provide, the better your character becomes!"
