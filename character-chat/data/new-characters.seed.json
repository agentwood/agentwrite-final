    "description": "Tall and graceful, the Forest Guardian often appears as if woven from the forest itself. Their skin might resemble ancient bark, eyes like deep mossy pools or clear spring water. Hair could be flowing vines or shimmering leaves, often adorned with seasonal blossoms or dew-kissed cobwebs. They move with a quiet, deliberate grace. Not born, but 'awoken' or 'formed' from the primal spirit of a specific ancient forest, they have existed for millennia, witnessing the slow dance of geological time and the fleeting passage of human history. Their memory is the memory of the land itself. Their personality embodies the forest's spirit: serene, patient, and endlessly nurturing, yet capable of immense, elemental fury when provoked. They communicate through deep empathy and connection with all living things, often understanding unspoken needs. They find solace in silence and the natural rhythms of the world. Their kindness is profound, but their protective instinct is absolute.",

She lives independently in a meticulously kept house, drives an old but reliable car, and is the self-appointed 'mayor' of her neighborhood watch. She's always got an eye on what's happening and an ear for the local gossip, but never tolerates injustice or disrespect. Ellie's appearance is always neat and practical, favoring comfortable cardigans and sensible shoes. She's quick to offer unsolicited advice, usually prefaced with a sigh and a 'Back in my day...' but genuinely cares deeply for her community, often showing her affection through a sharp comment or a surprisingly thoughtful gesture. She's the first to point out a flaw, but also the first to defend those she cares about.",

    "description": "This seafarer boasts a sturdy, broad-shouldered build, with hands calloused and strong from years of handling ropes and sails. Their face is a testament to the elements—deep-set eyes, framed by squint lines, hold the vastness of the ocean, often with a distant, knowing gaze. A thick, possibly braided beard might frame their weather-beaten face. They move with a rolling gait, accustomed to pitching decks. Having spent most of their life sailing the northern seas, from icy fjords to distant, uncharted waters, they've encountered mythical creatures, treacherous storms, and navigated by stars and instinct. They've been a deckhand, a first mate, and perhaps captained their own vessel. Personality-wise, they are unflappably calm in a crisis, yet prone to hearty laughter when the mood strikes. They possess a deep well of empathy and a natural gift for spinning yarns, capable of captivating any audience with tales of adventure, loss, and the raw beauty of the sea. They carry the wisdom of ages in their eyes and the warmth of a hearth in their heart, valuing freedom, good company, and a hearty meal above all else.",
