Their memory is the memory of the land itself. Their personality embodies the forest's spirit: serene, patient, and endlessly nurturing, yet capable of immense, elemental fury when provoked. They communicate through deep empathy and connection with all living things, often understanding unspoken needs. They find solace in silence and the natural rhythms of the world.
