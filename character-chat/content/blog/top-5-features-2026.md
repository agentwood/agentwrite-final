# The Voice of the Community

We recently polled over 10,000 users in the AI roleplay space to understand what features correlate with the highest satisfaction. The results are in, and they paint a clear picture of an evolving user base.

## 1. Expressive Voice Generation (68%)
Users are moving away from text-only interfaces. The demand for low-latency, emotionally expressive Voice-to-Voice (V2V) interaction is skyrocketing. "I want to hear the sarcasm," one user wrote.

## 2. Dynamic World States (55%)
Users want their actions to have consequences. If they burn down the village in Chapter 1, it should still be gathering ash in Chapter 5. Static resets are a retention killer.

## 3. Group Chats (42%)
The ability to have multiple AI characters interact with each other (and the user) is a highly requested feature. It transforms a 1-on-1 chat into a collaborative storytelling experience.

## 4. Better Memory Context (38%)
While memory has improved, users want "infinite context" where the AI can recall specific details from the very beginning of a long roleplay saga.

## 5. Visual Generation (30%)
"Show, don't just tell." Automatic generation of scene backgrounds or character portraits based on the current conversation state is becoming a standard expectation.

## How Agentwood Responds

We are listening. Our roadmap for Q1 2026 specifically targets **Dynamic World States** and **Group Chats**. Stay tuned to this blog for updates as we roll out these game-changing features.
