# Breathing Life into Code

Creating a compelling AI character is an art form. It sits somewhere between creative writing and coding. In this guide, we'll walk you through the Agentwood method for designing characters that stick.

## 1. The Core Identity (The "Who")

Don't just list traits. Define a *core drive*.
*   **Weak**: "He is a brave knight."
*   **Strong**: "He fights to redeem a past failure that haunts him every night."

The second prompt gives the AI a psychological anchor. It informs not just what they do, but *why* they do it.

## 2. Voice and Mannerisms

The way a character speaks is their fingerprint.
*   **Vocabulary**: Do they use high-flown, archaic language or gritty street slang?
*   **Rhythm**: Is their speech staccato and nervous, or flowing and confident?
*   **Verbal Tics**: Using specific phrases like "honestly," "wretched," or "literally" adds flavor.

*Pro-Tip: In Agentwood's creator mode, use the 'Voice Seed' preview to ensure the audio matches the text personality.*

## 3. The Scenario (The "Where")

Context is everything. A character met in a tavern behaves differently than one met on a battlefield. Set the scene vividly in your initial prompt to ground the AI's responses.

## 4. Testing and Iteration

Your first draft won't be perfect. Chat with your character. If they sound too generic, add a "Negative Prompt" or behavior restriction (e.g., "Do not be overly polite; be gruff").

Character creation is an iterative process. With Agentwood's advanced tools, you have the power to fine-tune every nuance until the digital soul matches your vision.
