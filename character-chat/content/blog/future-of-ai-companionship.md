# The Future of AI Companionship

As we enter 2026, the potential for AI companions has never been greater. At Agentwood, we believe that the next frontier is not just better text, but deeper emotional intelligence and cross-modal interaction.

## Beyond Large Language Models
While LLMs are the brain, the "heart" of an AI companion lies in its personality consistency and emotional resonance. We are working on features that allow characters to remember your preferences and grow with you over time.

## Our Vision
Our goal is to create a digital "wood" where every interaction feels unique, safe, and profoundly engaging.
