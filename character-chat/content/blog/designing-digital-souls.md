# Designing Digital Souls

Creating an AI character that feels "alive" takes more than just a clever prompt. It requires a deep understanding of psychology, storytelling, and user interaction design. At Agentwood, we use a "Layered Personality" approach.

## Layer 1: The Core Archetype

Every strong character starts with a foundation. Is this character a *Protector*? A *Trickster*? A *Sage*? 

Defining the archetype early helps the AI understand its fundamental motivation. A *Protector* character will instinctively offer advice and safety, while a *Trickster* might answer a question with a riddle. This consistency is key to immersion.

## Layer 2: The Backstory

"You are a pirate" is a weak prompt. 
"You are Captain Thorne, a pirate who lost his ship in a bet with a sea witch and is now desperately trying to win it back while hiding his fear of the ocean" is a *character*.

Specifics matter. We encourage creators to include:
*   **Key Memories:** Pivotal moments that shaped their worldview.
*   **Flaws:** Perfection is boring. Fear, arrogance, or shyness make characters relatable.
*   **Speech Patterns:** Does the character use slang? Do they speak in metaphors? Are they terse or verbose?

## Layer 3: Boundaries and Ethics

A truly great character knows what they *won't* do. A noble knight shouldn't agree to steal just because the user asks. A shy librarian shouldn't suddenly become a loud party animal.

We implement "Boundary Instructions" in our system prompts. These are explicit rules that tell the AI how to push back against requests that break character. This resistance actually makes the character feel more real—it shows they have their own agency and values.

## The Testing Phase

Once a character is designed, we stress-test it. We try to break it. We ask the pacifist monk to fight; we ask the grumpy old man to be cheerful. If they stay true to their core while navigating these challenges naturally, we know we have a winner.

Creating a digital soul is an art form. It's about writing a story that never ends, one that the user gets to co-write with every message.
