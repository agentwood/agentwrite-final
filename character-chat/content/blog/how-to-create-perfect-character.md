# How to Create the Perfect AI Roleplay Character

Creating a character is more than just picking a name and a photo. It's about crafting a soul. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the essential steps to make your AI character feel truly alive.

## 1. Start with the 'Why'
Every great character has a motivation. What drives them? What are they afraid of? Define these before you start writing dialogue.

## 2. The Power of the Greeting
The first message sets the tone. Make it specific to the character's personality and the setting.

## 3. Using Sensory Details
Describe the environment, the character's voice, and their small habits. This builds immersion faster than any complex plot.
