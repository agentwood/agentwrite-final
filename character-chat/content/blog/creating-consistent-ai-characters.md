One of the biggest frustrations in AI character creation is **Character Drift**. You spend hours crafting a stoic, 19th-century detective, but ten minutes into the chat, he's using emojis and saying "lol."

This happens because most platforms treat the "System Prompt" as just a suggestion. At Agentwood, we solved this with the **TREE-E Architecture**.

## What is TREE-E?
TREE-E stands for **Traversable Rational & Emotional Engine**. It separates a character into distinct layers that are treated differently by the AI.

### 1. The Voice Core (Layer 0)
This is the immutable DNA of the character.
*   **Locked Attributes**: Accent, Pitch, Cadence, Age.
*   **The Effect**: A refined British gentleman *cannot* physically speak like a surfer dude. The AI is constrained by its "voice."

### 2. The Emotional State Vector (Layer 1)
Emotions shouldn't change your personality; they should color it.
*   **Valence**: Good vs Bad.
*   **Arousal**: Calm vs Excited.
*   TREE-E tracks these numerically. A "Sad" detective is still a detective, just with lower valence.

### 3. Behavioral Personality (Layer 2)
This governs *how* they think.
*   **Logic vs Empathy**: Does the character prioritize facts or feelings?
*   **Optimism vs Pessimism**: Do they see the glass half full?

## How to Create Your Own Agentwood Character

1.  **Select a Voice Seed**: We are Voice-First. Pick a voice that matches your vision (e.g., "Deep, Raspy, Authoritative").
2.  **Define the Archetype**: Use our template sliders to set Empathy, Chaos, and Formality.
3.  **Write the Hook**: The Greeting sets the scene. Make it active like `*The detective leans back, lighting a cigarette* "You're late."`

## Conclusion
Consistency creates immersion. By using Agentwood's advanced creation tools, you're not just writing a prompt; you're building a psychological profile that persists.
