# Agentwood Logo Setup

## Logo Image Placement

The Agentwood logo has been updated in all components. To complete the setup:

1. **Place your logo image file** in the `public` folder:
   - File name: `agentwood-logo.png` (or `.svg`, `.jpg`, `.webp`)
   - Location: `/character-chat/public/agentwood-logo.png`

2. **Supported formats:**
   - PNG (recommended for transparency)
   - SVG (scalable vector)
   - JPG/JPEG
   - WebP

3. **Logo is now used in:**
   - ✅ Header component (top navigation on all pages)
   - ✅ Sidebar component (left navigation)
   - ✅ Footer component (site footer)

4. **Fallback:**
   - If the image fails to load, "Agentwood" text will appear as a fallback

## Current Logo Path

All components reference: `/agentwood-logo.png`

This means the file should be at: `character-chat/public/agentwood-logo.png`

## Image Specifications

Based on the logo description:
- White "AW" letters with black outline and drop shadow
- Light blue sky background with yellow clouds
- Sandy-brown landmass at bottom
- Cartoonish, flat graphic style

Recommended size: 200-300px width (height will scale proportionally)
